The dataset is too large to be uploaded to github. A representational dataset is uploaded here with the file name [vs_code_TD_dataset.csv]

The file [VS_code_Train_30TD.ipynb](https://github.com/durga256/Tech-Debt-Classification/blob/main/VS_code_Train_30TD.ipynb) implements DeBerta as mentioned in the our base paper - [Technical Debt Classification in Issue Trackers using Natural Language Processing based on Transformers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207085)
